# playstation_content_ids

On 16th October 2020, SIE announced that a brand-new PlayStation Store would launch between 21-26th October 2020 on the web and 28th October 2020 on the mobile app.

As a result of this, the ability to view and purchase content (i.e. games, add-ons, apps, themes and avatars) for PSP, PS3 and PS Vita was removed.

Aside from the impact to consumers, there is also an impact to Wikimedia Foundation projects such as Wikipedia and Wikidata which heavily rely on PlayStation Store as an official source of information for multiple aspects (e.g. launch dates, file sizes, etc.). The removal of all PSP, PS3 and PS Vita related content has resulted in countless citations being broken.

This project was created to support a collaborative effort between members of Video Game Preservation Collective, Wikimedia and Archive Team to archive as many web pages and data as possible before SIE decommissions the Valkyrie storefront.

## `regions` folder

SIE operates 94 different versions of PlayStation Store (66 countries and 19 languages). The content available differs by each country and the data associated to that content differs, too.

Located in the `regions` folder are lists of Content IDs pulled using APIs from the old version of PlayStation Store. They are newline-delimited lists in `.txt` files of available Content IDs for each region, generated by the `old_psn_product_fetcher.py` script documented below.

These files can be used as input for other scraping and dumping tools (see @mgrandi's `playstation_store_2020_oct_scrape` respository for more info).

## `scripts` folder

### `old_psn_product_fetcher.py` file

Downloads a list of Content IDs from the old PlayStation Store's API when given a language code (e.g. "en") and country code (e.g. "us").

```plaintext

$ python .\old_psn_product_fetcher.py --help

usage: old_psn_product_fetcher [-h] [--output_file_directory OUTPUT_FILE_DIRECTORY] region_language region_country

positional arguments:
  region_language       the region language, aka the `en` in `en-us`
  region_country        the region country, aka the `US` in `en-us`

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_file_directory OUTPUT_FILE_DIRECTORY
                        where to write the resulting file to, defaults to current directory

```

#### Example

```plaintext
python .\old_psn_product_fetcher.py en us --output_file_directory ../

language code: `en`, country code: `us`
starting at `2020-10-28T02:31:16.023758+00:00`

# etc etc

```

### `lzma_files.py` file

Given a folder of `.txt` files, it will compress them using `.xz` to a specified output folder.

```plaintext

$ py -3 .\lzma_files.py --help

usage: lzma_files [-h] source_files_folder dest_folder

positional arguments:
  source_files_folder  where the .txt files are located
  dest_folder          where to put the compressed files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
```

#### Example

```plaintext
